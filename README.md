*Timing*: Set a strict time limit of 90 minutes for yourself to complete the tasks ‚è≥. This practice is designed to simulate the time constraints often present in real assessments, fostering the development of effective time management skills.

*Sequential Progression*: Start with Level 1 and do not advance to the subsequent level until you have fully completed the preceding one üõ§Ô∏è. This methodical approach ensures a gradual and thorough understanding of the challenges presented.

*Testing and Development Environment*: Focus your coding efforts within the simulation.py file üñ•Ô∏è. This file is where you will implement your solutions and simulate the operations described in the tasks.

*Refactoring*: As you progress through the levels, revisit and refactor your earlier solutions as needed to accommodate the additional functionality required by later tasks üîß. This iterative process is key to developing scalable and maintainable software.

Once you're ready to begin
## start the exam
`pnpm test`
You can progress to the next level once all tests are passing for a given level are passing.
